This mod allows you to add planets to the starmap. 

I made this mod after researching all my planets and saw I had not a single Gas Giant, which I very much wanted, so I made a mod to make it happen and tweaked so others can use it. I hope you find it useful!

Please ensure to backup your save file before using this as you may place planets so that they overlap with others etc.

Planets are added using the "config.txt" file in the same folder as the installed mod.

On my machine this is in: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Steam

...and then within the mod folder

The config file comes already set to add one of each type of planet at varying distances and orbits, and works as follows:
GasGiant,0,0 	  ---> Adds a Gas Giant to the closest range (e.g. 10,0000km) at the far left
VolcanoPlanet,1,1 ---> Adds a Volcanic Planet to the second closest range, one in from the left
Satellite,2,2     ---> Adds a Satellite to the third closest range, 2 in from the left

Quick Instructions:
1) Edit "config.txt" to add the planets you want
2) Open the starmap on the save file you want to add the planets to (they are added un-researched so you will just see a planet is added, but not know which kind yet)
3) Save your map if everything went well (no planet overlaps etc.)

Note that the "config.txt" will become renamed to "config.txt.old" on the starmap being opened, so if you want to add more planets rename the file back to "config.txt".
This is to ensure additional saves are unaffected, and allows control of the planet generation per save by renaming the config file and loading up a save file you want to add planets to.
